      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/JacquieDuley.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Passionate and driven, I am a Radiologic Technologist studying computer programming to improve patient and
        provider experiences.</p>

      <p>I have been working healthcare for the past four years. I started as a front desk clerk and put myself
        through school to be a radiologic technologist. Working in medical imaging has been incredibly rewarding,
        however, I was introduced to coding by a friend who has worked as a full-stack engineer. </p>

      <p>I am working to become a strong full-stack engineer to merge my love for healthcare with the innovative
        field of software engineering. I will be looking to work for a healthcare based company since I know what
        the needs of healthcare practioners as well as patients are. </p>
